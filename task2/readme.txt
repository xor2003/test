Task 2 Coding 1

Classes:
Matrix - implement matrix

MatrixFixErrors - class which solves the task: replaces 0 values with interpolated data.
Neighbour values if avaliable are used to count average. If neighbour not present like side or corner cases then it is ignored 
and sum is calculated by other neighbours.

MatrixFromStreamInserter - can be used to load data to matrix from stdin or file

All classes have own responsibility. Classes can be mocked and unit-tested.
